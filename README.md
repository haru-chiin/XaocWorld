There was an error, it seems I tried to upload all the assets I used and it turned out I couldn't and kept disconnecting from the remote github. So this is the link to the assets I used more or less.
If you want to ask more, you can email me. 
* All the assets I use I found on the internet and I intend to use them as my learning as a game dev and do not intend to make them commercial.*
Thank you for your attention :D
